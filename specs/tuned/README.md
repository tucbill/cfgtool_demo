This directory contains all of the tuned profiles for use with Spectrum Scale configurations.

There are two subdirectories, organized for node type:
 - spectrum-scale-storage
 - spectrum-scale-storage

Each subdirectory will contain the recommended settings to be applied across a set of spectrum scale nodes. 
The contents of each subdirectory will include the tuned.conf file, as well as any other scripts referenced
by tuned.conf. 

There is also a file that explicilty maps the profiles to node classes.  See node_class_map.json.
